                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <P>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.</P>
                    <P>Elephants are known for their extraordinary memory, remembering locations of water sources and food over long distances, even after many years, as noted by Trafalgar Tours</P>
                    <P>Female elephants have the longest pregnancy of any mammal, lasting a remarkable 22 months, as reported by Action Change. </P>
                    <P>Elephant trunks are not just used for smelling but also for picking up objects, breathing, drinking water, and even cooling down with dust baths</P>
                    <strong> <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre</P>
